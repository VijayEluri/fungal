     <para>The Fungal kernel provides the foundation for standalone Java environments
       where it enables deployment of the services which makes up those environments.</para>

     <para>The Fungal kernel should be deployed as part of the application classloader for
       the application. This is typically done by bundling all the classes Fungal that makes
       up the kernel.</para>

     <para>The bundle would also include the main class for the environment, which sets up the
       kernel and its configuration and all utility classes such as kernel event listeners.</para>

     <para>This setup can be done by simply <code>unjar</code>ing the <code>fungal.jar</code> archive</para>

     <programlisting>
unjar xf fungal.jar
     </programlisting>

     <para>and then copy the applications main class and its dependencies into the directory.</para>

     <para>The application can then be started using a <code>Main-Class</code> attribute in the
       <code>MANIFEST.MF</code> file or by specifying the main class on the command line.</para>
