    <title>Overall goals</title>
    <para>The overall goals of our test environment is to execute tests that ensures that
    we have full coverage of the code in Fungal.</para>

    <para>The full test suite is executed using</para>

    <programlisting>
ant test
    </programlisting>

    <para>A single test case can be executed using</para>

    <programlisting>
ant -Dmodule=embedded -Dtest=org.jboss.jca.embedded.unit.ShrinkWrapTestCase one-test
    </programlisting>

    <para>where <code>-Dmodule</code> specifies which module to execute the test case in. This parameter
      defaults to <code>core</code>. The <code>-Dtest</code> parameter specifies the test case itself.</para>

    <para>You can also execute all test cases of a single module using</para>

    <programlisting>
ant -Dmodule=embedded module-test
    </programlisting>

    <para>where <code>-Dmodule</code> specifies which module to execute the test cases in. This
      parameter defaults to <code>core</code>.</para>

    <para>The build script does not fail in case of test errors or failure.</para>

    <para>
      You can control the behavior by using the <code>junit.haltonerror</code> and <code>junit.haltonfailure</code> 
      properties in the main <code>build.xml</code> file. Default value for both is <code>no</code>.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can of course change them statically in the <code>build.xml</code> file or temporary using <code>-Djunit.haltonerror=yes</code>.
      There are other <code>jnuit.*</code> properties defined in the main <code>build.xml</code> that can be controlled in the same
      way.

  <section id="qa">
    <title>Quality Assurance</title>
    <para>In addition to the test suite the Fungal project deploys various
      tools to increase the stability of the project.</para>
    <para>The following sections will describe each of these tools.</para>

    <section id="checkstyle">
      <title>Checkstyle</title>
      <para>Checkstyle is a tool that verifies that the formatting of the source
        code in the project is consistent.</para>

      <para>This allows for easier readability and a consistent feel of the project.</para>

      <para>The goal is to have zero errors in the report. The checkstyle report is generated
        using</para>

      <programlisting>
ant checkstyle
      </programlisting>

      <para>The report is generated into</para>

      <programlisting>
reports/checkstyle
      </programlisting>

      <para>The home of checkstyle is located here: <ulink url="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/"/>.</para>

    <section id="findbugs">
      <title>Findbugs</title>
      <para>Findbugs is a tool that scans your project for bugs and provides reports based on its
        findings.</para>

      <para>This tool helps lower of the number of bugs found in the Fungal project.</para>

      <para>The goal is to have zero errors in the report and as few exclusions in the filter as possible.
        The findbugs report is generated using</para>

      <programlisting>
ant findbugs
      </programlisting>

      <para>The report is generated into</para>

      <programlisting>
reports/findbugs

    <section id="cobertura">
      <title>Cobertura</title>
      <para>Cobertura generates a test suite matrix for your project which helps you identify
        where you need additional test coverage.</para>

      <para>The reports that the tool provides makes sure that the Fungal project has the correct test coverage.</para>

      <para>The goal is to have as high code coverage as possible in all areas. The Cobertura report is
        generated using</para>

      <programlisting>
ant cobertura
      </programlisting>

      <para>The report is generated into</para>

    <section id="tattletale">
      <title>Tattletale</title>
      <para>Tattletale generates reports about different quality matrix of the dependencies within the project.</para>

      <para>The reports that the tool provides makes sure that the Fungal project doesn't for example have
        cyclic dependencies within the project.</para>

      <para>The goal is to have as no issues flagged by the tool. The Tattletale reports are
        generated using</para>

      <programlisting>
ant tattletale
